Item 2. Case-Insensitive Stringsâ€”Part 

Difficulty: 7

So you want a case-insensitive string class? Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write one.
This Item is composed of three related points.

1. What does "case-insensitive" mean?

2. Write a ci_string class that is identical to the standard std::string class but that is case- insensitive in the same way as the commonly provided extension stricmp().[1] A ci_string should be usable as follows:
[1] The stricmp() case-insensitive string comparison function is not part of the C or C++ standards, but it is a common extension on many C and C++ compilers.
          ci_string s( "AbCdE" );
          // case insensitive
          //
          assert( s == "abcde" );
          assert( s == "ABCDE" );
          // still case-preserving, of course
          //
          assert( strcmp( s.c_str(), "AbCdE" ) == 0 );
          assert( strcmp( s.c_str(), "abcde" ) != 0 );

3. Is making case sensitivity a property of the object a good idea?
